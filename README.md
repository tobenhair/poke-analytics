# Sealed TCG Analytics

A single-page dashboard for tracking sealed trading-card **product** (Booster Box, Elite Trainer Box, Bundle) prices over time and deciding when to buy. It currently tracks Pokémon TCG products. Everything runs in the browser from one `index.html` file, reading and writing a single Excel workbook you keep under version control — no server, no database, no build step.

> Investment Decision Dashboard · Prices in EUR

## What it does

- **Ranks every product** by an age-weighted value score so newer and older releases can be compared fairly.
- **Surfaces buy signals** (💰) when a product's price drops while its set value holds steady — a possible mispricing.
- **Charts price history, set-value-per-booster trends, and age-vs-value** across all tracked products.
- **Scenario explorer** — drag sliders for set value and price to see how the score would move.
- **Monthly data entry** — punch in the latest prices, add new releases, attach Cardmarket links, and export an updated `.xlsx` ready to commit back to the repo.

## Getting started

Because the dashboard auto-loads `pokemon_data.xlsx` with a `fetch()`, it needs to be served over HTTP — opening `index.html` directly from disk (`file://`) will block that request. Serve the folder with any static server:

```bash
# Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# or Node
npx serve .
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>. The bundled `pokemon_data.xlsx` loads automatically. You can also drag-and-drop your own `.xlsx` onto the **Analysis** tab at any time.

The page pulls Chart.js and SheetJS from a CDN, so an internet connection is required on first load.

## The three tabs

| Tab | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| 👋 **Welcome** | Overview, glossary, and how the workflow fits together. |
| 📊 **Analysis** | The decision view — ranked table, KPIs, price/value charts, buy signals, and the scenario explorer. |
| ✏️ **Data Entry** | The monthly update view — enter the latest prices and set values, add products, edit Cardmarket URLs, and export the updated workbook. |

## Monthly workflow

1. Once a month, fetch the latest prices from Cardmarket.
2. Enter them in the **Data Entry** tab (today's date is pre-filled as the snapshot label).
3. Click **⬇ Export updated .xlsx** to download the refreshed workbook.
4. Replace `pokemon_data.xlsx` in the repo and commit it — the next visit reflects the new data.

Add new products at any time from the Data Entry tab; the product name must match exactly between both sheets.

## Optional: cloud sync + login

The default setup is a single static file with no accounts — the workbook is the
source of truth. If you'd rather have **per-user logins with data stored in the
cloud** (log in from any device, save without committing a file), you can point
the app at a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project while still hosting the
frontend on GitHub Pages. This is off unless you fill in `SUPABASE_CONFIG` in
`index.html`. See **[SUPABASE.md](SUPABASE.md)** for the full walkthrough.

## Data file format

`pokemon_data.xlsx` must contain two sheets with these exact (case-sensitive) column names. An optional `Links` sheet stores Cardmarket URLs.

### Sheet 1 — `Summary` (one row per product)

`Product` · `Type` (`BOX`, `ETB`, or `BUNDLE`) · `Release Date` · `Age (years)` · `Current Price (€)` · `Set Value (€)` · `Price / Booster (€)` · `SV / Booster` · `Age Weight` · `Wtd. Score`

### Sheet 2 — `Historical Data` (one row per product per snapshot)

`Product` (must match Summary exactly) · `Snapshot Date` (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`) · `Price (€)` · `Set Value (€)`

The in-app **File Format Guide** (linked from the upload panel) documents every field in detail.

## Key concepts

- **Set Value** — the total market value of all cards in a complete set.
- **Price / Booster** — product price ÷ boosters inside (BOX = 36, ETB = 9, BUNDLE = 6).
- **SV / Booster** — Set Value ÷ Price/Booster. Reads as a value-for-money **×multiple** — how many times the price of a *single booster* the whole set is worth (e.g. `185×`), **not** a euro-per-pack amount. The core comparability metric; works across all product types.
- **Age Weight** — 0–1 multiplier. Products under a year old are penalised; ≥3 years = 1.0.
- **Wtd. Score** — SV / Booster × Age Weight. The headline ranking metric.
- **Buy Signal (💰)** — flagged when price dropped ≥5% in the last snapshot while set value held within ±5%.
